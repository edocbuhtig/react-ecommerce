Reactjs eCommerce Starter Application.

Set-up Steps:

`
Git clone, & run npm install followed by npm start
`

Important Note:
- For all future latest nodejs versions you need to modify your package.json, as below for Reactjs to run in the browser, only if you face issues running npm start using the default added, start script command
  

 `
 "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start --openssl-legacy-provider",
    `
