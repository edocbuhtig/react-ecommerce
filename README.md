Reactjs eCommerce Starter Application.

Set-up Steps:

`
Git clone, & run npm install followed by npm start
`

Important Note:
- For all future latest nodejs versions you need to modify your package.json, as below to make Reactjs to run, only if you face issues running npm start using the default, start script command
  

 `
 "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start --openssl-legacy-provider",
    `
